## Research & Problem Statement

### Market Analysis

The e-commerce market has seen a significant shift toward personalization, with studies showing that 36% of consumers expect personalized products. However, traditional 2D preview systems fail to provide accurate representations of the final product, leading to customer dissatisfaction and high return rates.

### Technical Challenge

Creating an intuitive 3D customization interface that:

- Maintains high performance on various devices
- Provides realistic visualization without requiring specialized hardware
- Integrates seamlessly with AI design generation
- Delivers a low learning curve for non-technical users

### Innovation Approach

Our solution bridges these gaps by implementing:

- WebGL-based 3D rendering optimized for modern browsers
- Reactive state management for real-time customization
- Integration with advanced AI image generation
- A component-based architecture that simplifies future enhancements
